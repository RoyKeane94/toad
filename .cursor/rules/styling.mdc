# Formatting Rules

- This rule is for when Cursor is creating a new page

# Inheriting

- When creating a new page, please inherit [layout.html](mdc:templates/layout.html)
- There is no need to inherit inidividual style sheets into individual pages as everything is saved into [master.css](mdc:static/css/master.css)

# Styling and CSS

- As a root please use [styles.css](mdc:theme/static_src/src/styles.css)
- Please always look to style in tailwind - I am using tailwind v4
- Where tailwind is not suitable, please use [non-tailwind.css](mdc:static/css/non-tailwind/non-tailwind.css)
- This will all be collected into [master.css](mdc:static/css/master.css)
