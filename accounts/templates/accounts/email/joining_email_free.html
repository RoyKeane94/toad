    <p>I'm Tom, the founder of Toad. Thanks for joining us and helping shape a calmer way to plan.</p>
    <p>Your first grid is ready and waiting. It's a quick, interactive tour — no boring pop‑ups, I promise.</p>
    <p>You're starting with our Free plan, which gives you access to all the core features to get organised and productive.</p>
