First, I just want to say a huge thank you. The level of engagement, the number of you who are already using Toad regularly, and the quality of the feedback you've sent over the past two weeks has been incredible. It's been so motivating to see.

            <div class="message">
You spoke, and I listened. My focus has been on implementing your suggestions in a way that stays true to our "purposefully simple" philosophy. Here are the key improvements we've made, all based on your feedback.

Just as important as what we build is what we choose to leave out. A few of you have made excellent suggestions for features like two-way calendar sync, sub-tasks, and notes.
            </div>

            <div class="message">
We've decided not to build these, and I want to be transparent about why. Toad's purpose is to be the antidote to the complex, bloated software that creates more work than it saves. Our goal is to provide clarity, not more features.
            </div>

            <div class="message">
Instead of adding complexity, we believe the "Toad way" to solve these problems is often simpler:
            </div>
            
            <div class="message" style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>Toad is not a calendar:</strong> Many of you have asked for a full calendar sync. We've decided against this because our goal is to be a simple planner, not a complex scheduling tool. For key deadlines, you can still use the one-way calendar export to send a task to your diary.
            </div>
            
            <div class="message" style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>For complex projects with sub-tasks:</strong> We find it's much clearer to create a new, dedicated grid for that project. Our new grid switching system makes it super easy to switch between grids.
            </div>
            
            <div class="message" style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>No AI Grid Generation:</strong> Some of you suggested using AI to create grids. Our templates are the "thoughtful AI"—clear, proven starting points designed with care to solve your specific problems instantly.
