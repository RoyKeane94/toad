    <p>Hi{% if user.first_name %} {{ user.first_name }},{% else %},{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to Team Toad.</p>
    
    <p>A quick but important point:</p>
    
    <p>Toad isn't here to control how your team works.</p>
    
    <p>People will still use email, messages, paper, and whatever else works for them.</p>
    
    <p>That's fine.</p>
    
    <p>The shift is simple:</p>
    
    <p>when something matters, it lands in Toad.</p>
    
    <p>No process diagrams.</p>
    
    <p>No enforcement.</p>
    
    <p>Just one calm, shared place everyone can rely on.</p>
    
    <p>That's where Team Toad earns its keep.</p>
    
    <p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, just drop me a line.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">Tom<br/>Founder, Toad</p>
