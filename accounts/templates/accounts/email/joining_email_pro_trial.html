    <p>Hi{% if user.first_name %} {{ user.first_name }},{% else %},{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>You're now on a Team Toad trial.</p>
    
    <p>The best way to try Toad is not to roll out a new system.</p>
    
    <p>Keep working as you already do.</p>
    
    <p>But when something matters — a decision, a task, a loose end — put it in Toad.</p>
    
    <p>That's it.</p>
    
    <p>After a couple of weeks, you'll know whether having one place changes how things feel.</p>
    
    <p>If it does, great. If not, you've learned something.</p>
    
    <p>Either way is a good outcome.</p>
    
    <p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, just drop me a line.</p>
