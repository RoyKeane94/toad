    <p>Hi{% if user.first_name %} {{ user.first_name }},{% else %},{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>Happy New Year.</p>
    
    <p>Some people use Toad every day. Others mean to, but don't quite get round to it.</p>
    
    <p>Both are normal.</p>
    
    <p>January is a good excuse to put one real project in and see how it feels.</p>
    
    <p>You don't need a fresh setup or a new system.<br>
    Just open a grid and drop in something that's already on your mind.</p>
    
    <p>If Toad has been useful to you, you might know someone else who'd appreciate a calmer place to keep track.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a simple free Team Toad trial you can share with friends or your team — no setup, no expectations.</p>

<div class="message">
    <p>Use it yourself, pass it on, or ignore it — whatever makes sense.</p>
    
    <p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, just reply to this email — it comes straight to me.</p>
