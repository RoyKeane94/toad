<div class="greeting">Hi {{ user.first_name|default:user.get_short_name }},</div>

<div class="message">
    <p>A quick note, two days in.</p>
    
    <p>If Toad feels familiar rather than impressive, that's intentional.</p>
    
    <p>Most people get the most value from Toad when they do just one thing:</p>
    
    <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin: 20px 0;">Put one real project into one grid.</p>
    
    <p>Not everything. Not the perfect setup. Just something that's already on your mind.</p>
    
    <p>A few gentle pointers if you want them:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px; color: #4B5563;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">One grid per project or area works better than cramming everything into one place</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Keep it simple — rows for when it needs to be done, columns for what needs to be done</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Don't optimise it yet. If it's readable, it's working</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you're coming from notebooks, lists, or spreadsheets, you don't need to "learn" Toad.</p>
    
    <p>You already know how to use it — this just keeps things clear and shared.</p>
    
    <p>If you want, reply to this email and tell me what you're trying to organise.</p>
    
    <p>I'm happy to suggest a simple grid that fits how you already think.</p>
    
    <p>No rush. No setup to get right.</p>
</div>
