    <p>Hi{% if user.first_name %} {{ user.first_name }},{% else %},{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>If Toad feels familiar rather than impressive, that's intentional.</p>
    
    <p>Most people don't get value from setting everything up.<br>
    They get value from doing one small, sensible thing.</p>
    
    <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin: 20px 0;">
        Put one real project into one grid.
    </p>
    
    <p>Not everything. Not a perfect system.<br>
    Just something that's already taking up space in your head.</p>
    
    <p>If it helps, a few quiet guidelines:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px; color: #4B5563;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">One grid per project or area usually works better than forcing everything into one place</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Simple beats clever — if you can read it at a glance, it's doing its job</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Resist the urge to optimise. Clarity comes first</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you're coming from notebooks, lists, or spreadsheets, there's nothing new to learn.</p>
    
    <p>You already know how this works — Toad just keeps it clear, contained, and easy to return to.</p>
    
    <p>If you want, reply to this email and tell me what you're trying to organise.</p>
    
    <p>I'm happy to suggest a simple grid that fits how you already think.</p>
    
    <p>No rush. Nothing to get "right".</p>
